# Happy Birthday

from https://github.com/faahim/happy-birthday

I am using vite so I can using `.env` file

edit your `.env` as you like. You can refer to `.env.example` for some example :)

Using:

run `npm install` first.

then if you want to run in your local, run `npm run dev`

in your production site, run `npm run build`. In production after build, point the root html file to `dist/index.html`
